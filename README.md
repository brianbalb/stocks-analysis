# stocks-analysis

# Overview of Project
Project was requested by Steve to better understand the scope and investment success of stocks from the periods of 2017 and 2018. Steve and his parents, which are his primary benefactors, request to understand which companies to invest their funds. Using stock historical data and VBA we are able to help Steve find the best and secure place to secure his investors money.

## Process 

- We want to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. In return this will give us a better understand of potential future returns.  
- Furthermore I refactored the original code that was used in a handful of stocks to be able to handle a larger data set. 

# Results

## Steve believe that if a stock is traded often, then the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock. 

* As requested my analysis began looking at the yearly return's percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 
* Looking at analysis we determined that Daqo dropped over 63% in 2018, which would not make a wise choice for Steve's investors. 
* I further analyzed the selection of stocks by refactoring my ealier work to be able to analyze a larger sample of stocks for the years of 2017 and 2018. 
* In conclusion I can determine that for the year of 2017, stocks proformance was high and favorable while 2018 was a losing year.
*  In 2017 the highest return was 199.4% while the lowest being -7.2%. 
*  In 2018 the highest return was 84% while the lowest was 62.6%. 

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general
The advantages of refactoring scripts is being able keep process time down and keeps the scripts up to date and fresh. Refactoring scripts reduces confusion, future defects and allows for consistancy over rewritting code from scratch. It makes the scripts easier to maintain. 
The disadvantages of refactoring scripts is that it is time consuming from constant debugging and takes a lot of time. It is a constant back and forth tedious process that some might not be able to afford in both time and resources. 

### Advantages and disadvantage of my original VBA scripts 
The advantage of my original script is that it allowed me to analyse a small sample of data before moving on to the larger set of data. Refactoring allowed me to keep the data updated and clean by allowing me to go over the script to add comments. 
The disadvantage of my refactored script is that it took a long time because it introduced new bugs to my script that I had to continous troubleshoot. It was a neccasary process but it took a significant amount of time to repurpose the script for the new data set.
